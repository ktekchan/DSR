This file contains information about the generic parameters for the simulation.
These parameters will be fixed for all simulation runs.

Number of nodes: 150 (DSR can handle upto 200 nodes)

Area of Simulation: 1000x1000
X dim: 1000.0 m
Y dim: 1000.0 m

Simulation time: 200.0 sec

Cbr rate: 4.0 

The following parameters are fixed in the tcl script
Transmission range: 250 m
Carrier sense range: 300 m

Seed value changes to incorporate randomness.
Pause time changes with respect to the maximum speed of the nodes.

Total number of connections change with respect to requirement of the degree of
the network. Higher the degree of the network, greater the number of
connections.
